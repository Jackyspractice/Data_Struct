# Here are My HW practices
## min-Max Debug
1. output every swap result ==> swap with parent / Gparent
2. make sure no arrary is acessed in non
3. module every reusable function

## AVL Debug
1. final cout vectorserial must -1, because is serial from 1 start, but my input[] is from 0.
2. cant use department number to make tree, have to use department name, the result will be different. 
3. test input arent utf-8, change -f big5 -t utf-8, will also have different result.
